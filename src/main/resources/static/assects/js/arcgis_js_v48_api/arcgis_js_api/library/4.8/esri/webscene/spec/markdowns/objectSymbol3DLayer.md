# ObjectSymbol3DLayer

ObjectSymbol3DLayer is used to render Point geometries using a volumetric 3D shape (e.g., a sphere or cylinder) with a Symbol3D in a SceneView.

### Properties

| Property | Details
| --- | ---
| anchor | The positioning of the object relative to the geometry.<br>Must be one of the following values:<ul><li>`center`</li><li>`bottom`</li><li>`origin`</li><li>`top`</li></ul>
| depth | Object depth in meters, positive only
| enable | Type:`Boolean`
| heading | Rotation angle around Z axis in degrees. At 0 degrees, the model points in the direction of the Y-axis. Positive values indicate clockwise rotation (when looked at from the top). [Detailed description](static/objectSymbolLayerOrientation.md).
| height | Object height in meters, positive only
| [material](material.md) | The material used to shade the geometry.
| [resource](objectSymbol3DLayer_resource.md) | The primitive shape (primitive) or external 3D model (href) used to visualize the points.
| roll | Rotation angle around Y axis in degrees. At 0 degrees, the model is level. A positive value lifts the left part and lowers the right part of the model. [Detailed description](static/objectSymbolLayerOrientation.md).
| tilt | Rotation angle around X axis in degrees. At 0 degrees, the model is level. A positive value lifts the front and lowers the back of the model. [Detailed description](static/objectSymbolLayerOrientation.md).
| type | Specifies the type of symbol used.<br>Value of this property must be `Object`
| width | Object width in meters, positive only
