# color

Color is represented as a three or four-element array. The four elements represent values for red, green, blue, and alpha in that order. Values range from 0 through 255. If color is undefined for a symbol, the color value is null.

### Example

```json
{
  "color": [
    13,
    38,
    68,
    255
  ]
}
```
