# PointCloud Layer

Point cloud data is post-processed spatially organized lidar data that consists of large collections of 3D points. Elevations for the ground, buildings, forest canopy, highway overpasses, and anything else encountered during the lidar survey make up the point cloud data. Point cloud layers allow for fast visualisation of point cloud data in the browser.
