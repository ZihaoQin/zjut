# Feature Layer (ArcGISFeatureLayer)

Feature layers can be created by referencing a layer from either a map service or a feature service. Use a map service if you just want to retrieve geometries and attributes from the server and symbolize them yourself. Use a feature service if you want to take advantage of symbols from the service's source map document. Also, use a feature service if you plan on doing editing with the feature layer. Feature layers honor any feature templates configured in the source map document. Feature collection objects are used to create a feature layer based on the supplied definition.

### Properties

| Property | Details
| --- | ---
| disablePopup | Indicates whether to allow a client to ignore popups defined by the service item.
| id | A unique identifying string for the layer.
| itemId | Optional string containing the item ID of the service if it's registered on ArcGIS Online or your organization's portal.
| layerDefinition | Additional properties that define drawing information and other configurations for the layer.<br>See [layerDefinition properties](#layerdefinition-properties) table.
| layerType | String indicating the layer type.<br>Value of this property must be `ArcGISFeatureLayer`
| listMode | To show or hide layers in the layer list<br>Must be one of the following values:<ul><li>`show`</li><li>`hide`</li></ul>
| mode | 0 is snapshot mode. 1 is on-demand mode. 2 is selection-only mode. Used with ArcGIS feature services and individual layers in ArcGIS map services.
| opacity | The degree of transparency applied to the layer on the client side, where 0 is full transparency and 1 is no transparency.
| [popupInfo](popupInfo.md) | A popupInfo object defining the content of popup windows when you click or query a feature.
| refreshInterval | Refresh interval of the layer in minutes. Non-zero value indicates automatic layer refresh at the specified interval. Value of 0 indicates auto refresh is not enabled.
| screenSizePerspective | Apply [perspective scaling](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-layers-FeatureLayer.html#screenSizePerspectiveEnabled) to screen-size symbols.
| showLabels | Labels will display if this property is set to `true` and the layer also has a [labelingInfo](labelingInfo.md) property associated with it. This property can get stored in the web scene config and in the item/data.
| showLegend | Boolean value indicating whether to display the layer in the legend. Default value is `true`.
| title | A user-friendly string title for the layer that can be used in a table of contents.
| url | The URL to the layer. If the layer is not from a web service but rather a feature collection, then the url property is omitted.
| visibility | Boolean property determining whether the layer is initially visible in the web scene.


### layerDefinition properties

| Property | Details
| --- | ---
| capabilities | A comma separated list of supported capabilities, e.g. `Query,Editing`.
| definitionExpression | SQL-based definition expression string that narrows the data to be displayed in the layer.
| [drawingInfo](drawingInfo.md) | Contains the drawing and labeling information.
| [elevationInfo](elevationInfo.md) | Elevation info defines how features are aligned to ground or other layers.
| [featureReduction](featureReduction_select.md) | An object that specifies how features are reduced or aggregated, with the goal of decluttering the view or presenting the user with an aggregate visualization. If unset, every feature is rendered individually.
| maxScale | Represents the maximum scale at which the layer definition will be applied.
| minScale | Represents the minimum scale at which the layer definition will be applied.
